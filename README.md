second attempt at making a website

website made mainly following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvYnfMOUOJY&t=370s.

# description

This is intended to be hosted by myself, on either an old laptop or raspberry pi or load balenced between them.

Because of this, I will be trying to make this website not too resource intensive.

The hardware limitation shouldn't be too impactful on UX, e.g. slow loading, as the website is designed for a small business which should recieve much traffic.

As this is for a busniess, I will need to keep search engine optimisation in mind.

# Goals:

- Instead of copy pasting all but `<section>` for each page, I want to make use of templates made specifically for my website.
- Search Engine Optimisation, while I don't expect it to recieve a lot of traffic, I want to make sure it is noticeable.
- As I am following a youtube tutorial there will inevitably be similar websites to mine, as my experience grows, I want to have it be unique/my own creation.
