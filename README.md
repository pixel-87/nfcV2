second attempt at making a website

website made mainly following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvYnfMOUOJY&t=370s.

# description

This is intended to be hosted by myself, on either an old laptop or raspberry pi or load balenced between them.

Because of this, I will be trying to make this website not too resource intensive.

The hardware limitation shouldn't be too impactful on UX, e.g. slow loading, as the website is designed for a small business which should recieve much traffic.

As this is for a busniess, I will need to keep search engine optimisation in mind.

# Goals:

- Instead of copy pasting all but `<section>` for each page, I want to make use of templates made specifically for my website.
- Search Engine Optimisation, while I don't expect it to recieve a lot of traffic, I want to make sure it is noticeable.
- As I am following a youtube tutorial there will inevitably be similar websites to mine, as my experience grows, I want to have it be unique/my own creation.

## Ideas:

### Unique/Personal design:

- To differentiate it from the video I want to add more to the home page, I want to add parallax scrolling, links on the home page as well that take you to different sections
- add a top of page button
- add horizontal nav bar on home page below image
- make logo a button that takes you back to home page
- when toggling the menu, have it take up only part of the screen, and slides back when clicking something outside of it

#### top of page button

- have it appear when the user scrolls past a certain point, and disappear when scrolling back up

## Attempts:

### Templating:

As there isn't that much HTML code repeated from page to page, the use of templates or static site generators seems to be wastful, as there isn't that much overhead with the current pages.
